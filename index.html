            <h2>Dear Simun Nani Aka Future Doctor,</h2>

            <p>
                First of all, I just want to say how really proud I am that my elder sister is doing MBBS; you're going to be a doctor soon, and congratulations for that.
            </p>

            <p>
                And secondly, I'm going to miss you a lot.
            </p>

            <p>
                Honestly, you have always been an inspiration to me. I was never really interested in JEE and all, but after seeing you clear NEET, I got inspired.
                Now I'm trying to clear JEE too and get into a really good college just like you did, and make everyone in our family proud especially you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you so much for always being there for me, helping me, and guiding me toward a better future.
                Thank you for teaching me physics and chemistry, I still remember everything you taught me, and it’s helping me a lot now.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, I just want to say: all the very best for your future.
                I'm sure you'll do great and keep winning in life.
                Keep inspiring others, just like you've inspired me.
            </p>

            <p class="end">With love ❤️</p>
